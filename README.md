# Unified AI Platform

A comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform for building, managing, and observing AI applications. It offers a unified interface for data ingestion, model configuration, pipeline orchestration, and real-time observability, enabling developers and enterprises to design, deploy, and scale robust AI solutions efficiently.

Beyond Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a service, the platform also provides an agent workflow builder, fine-tuning services, and Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It delivers an end-to-end AI lifecycle—from data preparation and training to deployment and monitoring—covering all essential steps required to build and operate production-ready AI systems.

### 4. Advanced Ingestion Pipeline
Take full control over how your data is processed. Configure every step of the RAG pipeline:
*   **Chunking Strategy**: Customize chunk size and overlap to optimize retrieval.
*   **Embedding Models**: Select from various embedding models (e.g., all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to suit your accuracy/performance needs.
*   **Vector Store**: Choose your preferred vector database (MongoDB, Milvus, etc.).
*   **Pipeline Execution**: Run and monitor long-running ingestion tasks with real-time logs.
